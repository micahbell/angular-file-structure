# Angular File Structure - Unit 2, Lesson 1

**What are possible issues with this new file structure?**


**When thinking about extending the single responsibility principle to the app structure, what are some other ways that the app could be structured?**


In object-oriented programming, the single responsibility principle states that every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.


**What are the differences between serving files from an http server and from the file system? It seemed to work fine with just open index.html in the browser...**

**Reflecting on the new structure and thinking back to lesson 1 - is Angular an MVC framework? How does the app structure support/disprove that?**
